    <h1>Going home... ain't that easy</h1>
    <p>Gonna tell u the truth, I'm beaten down. Training was hellish, but enjoyable.
        Though back on track: should I take the bus or go with Francis?
        Pros to bus: I can just lay there existing, saving my legs.
        Cons to Francis: I have to walk with him to the parking lot, which simply put, not an option.
        So yeah... pretty bias, but like talking to Francis the whole trip would be dope.
        So... you tell me:
        <a href="">Bus?</a>
        <a href="">Francis?</a>
