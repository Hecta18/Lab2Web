    <h1>Going home... ain't that easy</h1>
    <p>Gonna tell u the truth, I'm beaten down. Training was hellish, but enjoyable.<br>
        Though back on track: should I take the bus or go with Francis?<br>
        <ul>    
            <li>Pros to bus: I can just lay there existing, saving my legs.</li>
            <li>Cons to Francis: I have to walk with him to the parking lot, which simply put, not an option.</li>
        </ul>
        So yeah... pretty bias, but like talking to Francis the whole trip would be dope.<br>
        So... you tell me:<br>
        <ul>    
            <li><a href="/paginas/Bus.html">Bus</a></li>
            <li><a href="/paginas/Francis.html">Francis</a></li>
        </ul>
